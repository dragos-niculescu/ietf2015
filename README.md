# WiFi Mobility #

This is a mac80211 patch which can be used to eliminate the handoff process in 802.11 and maintain active TCP streams in the case of mobile clients, effectively granting mobility over wireless networks by constantly switching channels.

### Summary ###

* One device, multi-channel
* Can be used with network-manager
* Vendor-independent - all modifications are within mac80211 and cfg80211
* Dynamic - channel switching is triggered when associating with multiple access points

### Requirements ###

This has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04.02 LTS using an Atheros 9k.

* Download and install [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
* install some needed packages 
```
apt-get install curl build-essential git
```
* Set up [MPTCP](http://multipath-tcp.org/pmwiki.php/Users/HowToInstallMPTCP?) 
  * patch works for other Ubuntu versions (precise), but make sure you use trusty repos, so that kernel 3.14.0-89 is used
  * for 32bit, use wheezy (tested on Ubuntu 14.04 32bit, some problems with network-manager) 
  * ```wget -q -O - http://multipath-tcp.org/mptcp.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add - ```
  * ```echo 'deb http://multipath-tcp.org/repos/apt/debian trusty main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mptcp.list```
  * ```apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade && apt-get install linux-mptcp ```
  * automatic routing 
    * [mptcp_up](https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp-scripts/raw/master/scripts/rt_table/mptcp_up) - Place it inside /etc/network/if-up.d/ and make it executable.
    * [mptcp_down](https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp-scripts/raw/master/scripts/rt_table/mptcp_down) - Place it inside /etc/network/if-post-down.d/ and make it executable.
  * reboot
* clone driver updates and scripts :
```
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/dragos-niculescu/ietf2015.git 
cd ietf2015
```  

### Setting up ###

#### Building ####

* Turn off wireless from the GUI.
* Replace wpa_supplicant 
```
pkill wpa_supplicant
mv /sbin/wpa_supplicant /sbin/wpa_supplicant.orig
cp ./wpa_supplicant /sbin
```
* Unload wireless drivers and build new 802.11 module:
```
service network-manager stop 
./wm unload 
#make sure mac80211 and cfg80211 are unloaded: they may be blocked by other drivers(iwlwifi,ath9k_htc) 
./wm build
./wm load
#loaded multichannel driver 
```
#### Adding virtual interfaces (vifs) ####

```
./wm vifs add <wireless_interface_name> <index>
```

Vif names will typically be of the form `v#_wlan%`. For example:

```
./wm vifs add wlan0 1
```

Will add `v1_wlan0` to the list of interfaces.

Each new virtual interface will be used to associate to a different SSID. NetworkManager will automatically bring it up and attempt to associate.
By using **wm** to add virtual interfaces, a new MAC address is given, derived from the base interface MAC address. The new driver will timeshare between the two interfaces on their respective channels 

```
ifconfig wlan0 up 
ifconfig v1_wlan0 up 
```

 
#### Restart network manager ####

```
service network-manager start
```
Both cards should be visible in the GUI, and you should be able to choose an ESSID for each card. 
Associate to various networks on both cards so that passwords are not required later at handoffs. 


### verify proper MPTCP connectivity 

```
ip ro # shows routes across each virtual interface 
# should answer something like:
# subnet0 dev wlan0 ... src IP0
# subnet1 dev wlan1 ... src IP1

ip ru sh 
# shows outgoing rules across IP0 and IP1
# ????: from IP0 lookup 1
# ????: drom IP1 lookup 2

#verify outside IPs across both networks
curl --interface IP0 http://141.85.37.151/static/ietf/whatip.php
curl --interface IP1 http://141.85.37.151/static/ietf/whatip.php
```
If these are not working as expected, MPTCP routes are not set up when bringing interfaces up, and they may need to be set up statically, according to 
(http://multipath-tcp.org/pmwiki.php/Users/ConfigureRouting) 


#### install measurement script 

This shell script periodically downloads a small file across each interface with regular TCP, and then across both interfaces with MPTCP. 
```
cp measurement_bw.sh /bin
```

* entries to be added to crontab to automate downloading and reporting
```
measurement_bw.sh crontab 
#recommended entries
WLAN0=wlan0
WLAN1=v1_wlan0
0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * measure_bw.sh start_short $WLAN0   
1,11,21,31,41,51 * * * * measure_bw.sh stop; measure_bw.sh start_short $WLAN1   
2,12,22,32,42,52 * * * * measure_bw.sh stop; measure_bw.sh start_long $WLAN0   
4,14,24,34,44,54 * * * * measure_bw.sh stop; measure_bw.sh start_long $WLAN1   
6,16,26,36,46,56 * * * * measure_bw.sh stop; measure_bw.sh start_short multi
7,17,27,37,47,57 * * * * measure_bw.sh stop; measure_bw.sh start_long multi   
9,19,29,39,49,59 * * * * measure_bw.sh stop; measure_bw.sh upload 
```
make sure WLAN0 and WLAN1 reflect actual wireless interfaces

#### data collection

* As can be gathered from the above crontab script, data collection means downloading 
2MB chunks every 2 minutes across each interface with legacy TCP, and using MPTCP. Logs of these transfers
are periodically updated to http://mobil4.org. Consult the script /sbin/measure_bw.sh for details. 
* keep laptop online and use normally


#### revert laptop to original state 
```
crontab -e 
# and in editor remove all measurement entries

#bring back original supplicant
mv /sbin/wpa_supplicant.orig /sbin/wpa_supplicant 

#remove mptcp kernel 
apt-get remove linux-mptcp 
 
#remove mptcp startup scripts 
rm /etc/network/if-up.d/mptcp_up
rm /etc/network/if-post-down.d/mptcp_down
rm /bin/measure_bw.sh 
```

* reboot

### Future updates ###

* Automatic SSID association to ensure "hands-free" operation
* Throughput maximization
* Optimal SSID choice
